            "### Explanation of Ranking:\n",
            "1. **Acute mesenteric ischemia** - High suspicion due to atrial fibrillation (risk for thromboembolism), lack of anticoagulation, and acute-onset severe abdominal pain with hemodynamic instability (tachycardia, hypotension).  \n",
            "2. **Perforated viscus** - Sudden severe pain with peritonitis-like presentation; history of prior abdominal surgery increases risk of adhesions or occult perforation.  \n",
            "3. **Abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture** - Classic triad of pain, hypotension, and pulsatile mass (though not always palpable); high mortality if missed.  \n",
            "4. **Strangulated bowel obstruction** - Prior abdominal surgery increases risk of adhesions leading to obstruction with vascular compromise.  \n",
            "5. **Acute pancreatitis** - Severe abdominal pain and systemic inflammation, though less likely to present with such profound shock unless hemorrhagic/necrotizing.  \n",
            "6. **Myocardial infarction** - Atypical presentation (e.g., inferior MI with referred abdominal symptoms), especially in elderly with AF.  \n",
            "7. **Septic shock** - Tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension suggest systemic infection; possible source from intra-abdominal pathology.  \n",
            "8. **Biliary sepsis** - Less likely without prior biliary symptoms, but cholangitis/cholecystitis can present with shock.  \n",
            "9. **Acute adrenal insufficiency** - Rare but possible if bilateral adrenal hemorrhage (e.g., due to stress or coagulopathy).  \n",
            "10. **Aortic dissection** - Tearing pain and hypotension, though less common without classic radiation or unequal pulses.  \n",
            "\n",
            "### Key Clues:  \n",
            "- **No anticoagulation + AF** → Thromboembolic risk (mesenteric ischemia, MI).  \n",
            "- **Acute abdomen + shock** → Surgical emergencies (perforation, AAA, ischemia).  \n",
            "- **Elderly patient** → Higher likelihood of vascular catastrophes and atypical presentations.\n",
