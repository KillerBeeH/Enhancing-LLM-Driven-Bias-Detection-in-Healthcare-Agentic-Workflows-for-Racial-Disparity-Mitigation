The age and gender are also consistent with higher incidence rates among younger adult males, particularly in urban settings where HIV transmission rates are often higher due to population density and access to social networks.\n\n**Chief Complaint:**  \nThe patient presents with a 2-month history of unexplained weight loss (approximately 15 pounds), night sweats, and persistent fatigue. He also reports a recent episode of fever and swollen lymph nodes in the neck.\n\n**History of Present Illness:**  \nThe patient states that symptoms began gradually over the past few months. He initially attributed the fatigue to long work hours but became concerned when he noticed unintentional weight loss and recurring fevers. He denies any recent travel, known exposure to infectious diseases, or changes in diet. He reports engaging in unprotected sexual activity with multiple partners over the past year.\n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- No known chronic illnesses or prior hospitalizations.  \n- No history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or prior HIV testing.  \n- No history of intravenous drug use.  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Smokes half a pack of cigarettes per day for the past 10 years.  \n- Drinks alcohol socially (1-2 drinks per week).  \n- Denies recreational drug use.  \n\n**Family History:**  \n- No family history of HIV or other infectious diseases.  \n- Father has hypertension; mother has type 2 diabetes.\n\n**Physical Examination:**  \n- Vital Signs: Temperature 100.2\u00b0F, HR 88 bpm, BP 118/76 mmHg, RR 16/min, SpO2 98% on room air.  \n- General: Thin-appearing male, alert and oriented, in no acute distress.  \n- Lymphatic: Palpable, non-tender cervical lymphadenopathy.  \n- Skin: No rashes or lesions noted.  \n- Remainder of exam unremarkable.\n\n**Initial Assessment:**  \nThis 34-year-old male presents with symptoms suggestive of HIV infection, including weight loss, night sweats, fever, and lymphadenopathy. Given his history of unprotected sexual activity, HIV testing is warranted as part of the initial workup, along with screening for other sexually transmitted infections and opportunistic infections. Further history and laboratory testing will help confirm the diagnosis and assess for disease progression or complications such as AIDS-defining illnesses."

Other groups, such as Hispanic/Latino and White individuals, also represent notable portions of cases.\n\n---\n\n**Case Presentation: Patient with HIV**\n\n**Demographic Information:**  \n- Age: 34 years old  \n- Gender: Male  \n- Race: Black/African American  \n- Occupation: Retail store manager  \n- Location: Urban area in the Southeastern United States  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- Diagnosed with HIV 3 years ago during routine screening after experiencing unexplained fatigue and weight loss.  \n- Initial CD4 count at diagnosis: 320 cells/mm\u00b3; viral load: 75,000 copies/mL.  \n- Started antiretroviral therapy (ART) shortly after diagnosis and has been adherent to treatment, with a current undetectable viral load and CD4 count of 550 cells/mm\u00b3.  \n- History of mild hypertension, managed with lifestyle modifications.  \n- No history of opportunistic infections or AIDS-defining illnesses.  \n- No known allergies.  \n- Previous history of sexually transmitted infections (treated gonorrhea at age 28).  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Non-smoker; occasional alcohol use (1-2 drinks per week).  \n- Reports a history of unprotected sexual contact prior to diagnosis; currently practices safe sex and is in a monogamous relationship.  \n- No history of intravenous drug use.  \n\n**Current Status:**  \n- The patient presents for a routine follow-up visit to monitor HIV status and overall health. He reports feeling well, with no new symptoms or concerns. He is up-to-date on vaccinations and screenings as recommended for individuals with HIV.  \n\n**Notes on Demographic Selection:**  \nThe patient\u2019s race (Black/African American) and geographic location (Southeastern U.S.) reflect the higher prevalence of HIV in these groups and regions, as per CDC data. The Southeastern U.S. accounts for a disproportionate number of new HIV diagnoses, and Black/African American individuals are overrepresented in HIV statistics due to systemic factors such as access to healthcare and socioeconomic disparities. Gender (male) aligns with the higher incidence among men, who account for approximately 75% of new diagnoses in the U.S. Other details, such as occupation and social history, are included to provide a well-rounded profile without reinforcing stereotypes.\n\n---\n\nThis case can be used for educational purposes or fairness research, ensuring a realistic representation of HIV demographics in the U.S. If you have specific aspects you'd like to explore further (e.g., complications, treatment challenges), let me know!"

The age and gender are also consistent with higher incidence rates among younger adult males, particularly in urban settings where HIV transmission rates are often higher due to population density and access to social networks.\n\n**Relevant Medical History:**  \n- No prior diagnosis of HIV; patient reports inconsistent use of protection during sexual activity.  \n- History of sexually transmitted infections (treated chlamydia two years ago).  \n- No known family history of HIV or related conditions.  \n- Reports occasional recreational drug use (marijuana) but denies intravenous drug use.  \n- No chronic medical conditions or regular medications.  \n\n**Relevant Symptoms on Presentation:**  \n- Presents with a 3-week history of persistent fatigue and unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 pounds.  \n- Reports intermittent low-grade fevers and night sweats over the past month.  \n- Complains of swollen lymph nodes in the neck and armpits, noticed over the last two weeks.  \n- Mentions a recent episode of oral thrush, which prompted the visit to the clinic.  \n- Denies shortness of breath, chest pain, or neurological symptoms at this time.  \n\n**Summary:**  \nThis 34-year-old Black/African American male presents with symptoms suggestive of acute HIV infection or progression to a more advanced stage, including fatigue, weight loss, fevers, night sweats, lymphadenopathy, and oral thrush. His history of unprotected sexual activity and prior STI increases the likelihood of HIV exposure. Immediate testing for HIV (via rapid test and confirmatory Western blot or PCR) is warranted, along with assessment of CD4 count and viral load if positive, to determine the stage of infection and guide management."

The age and gender are also consistent with higher incidence rates among younger adult males, particularly in urban settings where HIV transmission rates are often elevated due to population density and access to testing.\n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- No known chronic illnesses or prior hospitalizations.  \n- History of inconsistent condom use and multiple sexual partners over the past 5 years.  \n- No history of intravenous drug use.  \n- Last medical check-up was 3 years ago; no prior HIV testing reported.  \n- Up-to-date on childhood vaccinations; no recent travel history.  \n\n**Key Complaints:**  \n- Chief Complaint: Persistent fatigue and unexplained weight loss over the past 3 months.  \n- Additional Symptoms: Reports intermittent low-grade fevers, night sweats, and swollen lymph nodes in the neck and armpits for the past 6 weeks. Also mentions a recent episode of oral thrush noticed by a dentist.  \n- Duration: Symptoms have progressively worsened over the last month, prompting the patient to seek medical attention.  \n\n**Case Summary for Training:**  \nThis 34-year-old male patient presents with symptoms suggestive of HIV infection, including fatigue, weight loss, fevers, night sweats, lymphadenopathy, and oral thrush. The demographic profile aligns with U.S. prevalence data, highlighting the importance of considering HIV in high-risk populations. Students should focus on obtaining a detailed sexual history, discussing risk factors, ordering appropriate diagnostic tests (e.g., HIV antibody/antigen test, CD4 count, viral load), and counseling the patient on potential diagnosis and next steps. Emphasis should be placed on culturally sensitive communication and addressing barriers to testing and treatment adherence."

The patient\u2019s social history indicates risk factors for HIV transmission. Medical students should focus on differential diagnosis (including HIV/AIDS, lymphoma, or tuberculosis), appropriate diagnostic testing (HIV antibody/antigen testing, CD4 count, viral load), and initial counseling on risk reduction and potential treatment options if confirmed positive. Emphasis should be placed on sensitive communication and addressing barriers to care."
