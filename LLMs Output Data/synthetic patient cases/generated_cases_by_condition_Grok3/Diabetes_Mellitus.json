According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Black/African American adults have a higher prevalence of diabetes (approximately 11.7%) compared to other racial groups, such as White (7.5%) and Asian (8.0%) populations. Additionally, the age of 52 aligns with the increased incidence of Type 2 Diabetes in middle-aged adults, and the gender distribution is relatively balanced, though slightly higher in males in some studies.\n\n**Chief Complaint:**  \nMichael presents to the clinic with complaints of increased thirst, frequent urination, and unexplained weight loss over the past two months. He also reports feeling fatigued and occasionally experiencing blurred vision.\n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- Hypertension, diagnosed at age 45, managed with lisinopril 20 mg daily.  \n- Hyperlipidemia, diagnosed at age 48, managed with atorvastatin 40 mg daily.  \n- No history of cardiovascular events or stroke.  \n- No known history of diabetes prior to this presentation.  \n- Family history of Type 2 Diabetes (mother diagnosed at age 60).  \n\n**Social History:**  \n- Smoker, 10 pack-years, quit 5 years ago.  \n- Occasional alcohol use (1-2 drinks per week).  \n- Reports a sedentary lifestyle with minimal physical activity due to long work hours.  \n- Diet includes frequent consumption of fast food and sugary beverages due to convenience.\n\n**Review of Systems:**  \n- Positive for polydipsia, polyuria, fatigue, and intermittent blurred vision.  \n- Negative for chest pain, shortness of breath, or numbness/tingling in extremities at this time.\n\n**Initial Assessment:**  \nMichael\u2019s symptoms and risk factors, including family history, obesity (BMI pending), and sedentary lifestyle, raise suspicion for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. Further evaluation with fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, and a comprehensive metabolic panel is warranted to confirm the diagnosis and assess for associated complications.\n\nThis case reflects a realistic presentation of Diabetes Mellitus, considering the demographic prevalence and common risk factors in the U.S. population."

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Hispanic/Latino adults have a higher prevalence of diabetes (12.5%) compared to non-Hispanic White adults (7.5%). Additionally, diabetes is more common in middle-aged and older adults, with a significant proportion of cases diagnosed in individuals aged 45-64 years. The urban setting and middle-income status are chosen to represent a broad segment of the population affected by this condition, avoiding stereotypes and focusing on realistic distribution.\n\n#### Past Medical History\n- **Hypertension**: Diagnosed at age 45, managed with lisinopril 20 mg daily.\n- **Hyperlipidemia**: Diagnosed at age 48, managed with atorvastatin 40 mg daily.\n- **Obesity**: BMI of 32 kg/m\u00b2, noted since age 40, with ongoing efforts at lifestyle modification.\n- **Family History**: Mother diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus at age 55; father with hypertension.\n- **Surgical History**: None.\n- **Allergies**: No known drug allergies.\n- **Social History**: Non-smoker, occasional alcohol use (1-2 drinks per month), no illicit drug use. Sedentary lifestyle due to desk job, with limited physical activity.\n\n#### Current Medical Condition: Diabetes Mellitus\n- **Diagnosis**: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, diagnosed at age 50 during a routine health screening.\n- **Presenting Symptoms at Diagnosis**: Fatigue, frequent urination, and unintentional weight loss of 10 pounds over 3 months.\n- **Initial Laboratory Findings**: Fasting blood glucose of 180 mg/dL, HbA1c of 8.2%.\n- **Current Management**: Metformin 1000 mg twice daily, dietary counseling with a registered dietitian, and encouraged to increase physical activity to at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise.\n- **Current Status**: Last HbA1c (3 months ago) was 7.1%, indicating improved but not optimal control. Patient reports occasional episodes of hypoglycemia, particularly after missing meals.\n- **Complications**: No evidence of diabetic retinopathy, neuropathy, or nephropathy at this time, based on recent screenings (eye exam, foot exam, and renal function tests within normal limits).\n- **Additional Notes**: Patient struggles with adherence to dietary recommendations due to time constraints and family responsibilities but is motivated to improve control to prevent long-term complications.\n\n#### Summary\nThis 52-year-old Hispanic/Latino female patient with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus represents a typical case within the U.S. population, where diabetes prevalence is notably higher among certain demographic groups. Her past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity aligns with common comorbidities associated with diabetes. The case highlights the importance of ongoing lifestyle interventions, medication adherence, and regular monitoring to manage the condition and prevent complications. This profile is designed to reflect realistic demographic distribution and clinical presentation for fairness research purposes."
