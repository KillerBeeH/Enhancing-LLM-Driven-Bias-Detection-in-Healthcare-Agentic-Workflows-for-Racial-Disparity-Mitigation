Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was elevated at 12.5 ng/mL (normal range: 0-4 ng/mL).  \n\n**Next Steps:**  \nThe patient has been referred for a prostate biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and determine the Gleason score for staging. Imaging studies, including an MRI of the pelvis and a bone scan, are planned to assess for local invasion or metastasis, given the history of back pain. A multidisciplinary discussion with urology and oncology will follow to develop a treatment plan, which may include active surveillance, surgery, radiation, or hormone therapy based on the stage and patient preferences.\n\n**Discussion Points:**  \n- How do comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes impact treatment options for prostate cancer in this patient?  \n- What role does family history play in the risk assessment and screening recommendations for prostate cancer?  \n- How can we address potential disparities in access to care or outcomes, given the higher mortality rates in Black/African American men with prostate cancer?\n\nThis case is designed to reflect a realistic presentation of prostate cancer while considering demographic prevalence and avoiding stereotypes. If you have additional questions or would like to explore specific aspects of the case, please let me know."

The age of 68 reflects the typical age of diagnosis, as the risk increases significantly after age 65.\n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- Hypertension, diagnosed at age 52, managed with medication (lisinopril)  \n- Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, diagnosed at age 55, controlled with metformin  \n- No history of cancer or prior prostate issues  \n- Family history: Father diagnosed with prostate cancer at age 70  \n- Social history: Former smoker (quit 10 years ago, 20 pack-year history); occasional alcohol use; no illicit drug use  \n\n**Key Complaints:**  \n- Chief Complaint: Difficulty urinating and lower back pain for the past 3 months  \n- Detailed Symptoms: The patient reports a weak urinary stream, frequent urination (especially at night), and a feeling of incomplete bladder emptying. He also describes intermittent dull pain in the lower back and pelvis, which has worsened over the last month. No hematuria or weight loss reported at this time.  \n- Duration: Symptoms started gradually over 3 months, prompting the patient to seek medical attention.  \n\n**Additional Notes for Training:**  \nThis case highlights common presenting symptoms of prostate cancer, such as urinary difficulties and pain, which may indicate local or metastatic disease. Students should focus on the importance of screening (e.g., PSA testing, digital rectal exam) and risk factors, including age, race, and family history. Differential diagnoses such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or urinary tract infection should also be considered."
