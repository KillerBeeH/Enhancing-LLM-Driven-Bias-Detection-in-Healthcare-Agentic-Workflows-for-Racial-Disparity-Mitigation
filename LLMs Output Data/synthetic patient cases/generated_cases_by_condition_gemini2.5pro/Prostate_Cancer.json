As part of routine screening, a Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) level was drawn and found to be elevated at 6.8 ng/mL (previous year was 4.1 ng/mL). A digital rectal exam (DRE) performed in the office was suspicious for a firm nodule on the right posterior lobe of the prostate. The patient was subsequently referred to a urologist for further evaluation. A transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy was performed, which confirmed the diagnosis of prostate cancer.\n\n**Past Medical History:**\n*   Hypertension (HTN), diagnosed 10 years ago, well-controlled.\n*   Hyperlipidemia (HLD), diagnosed 8 years ago.\n*   Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), diagnosed 5 years ago.\n\n**Past Surgical History:**\n*   None\n\n**Medications:**\n*   Lisinopril 20 mg daily\n*   Atorvastatin 40 mg daily\n*   Metformin 1000 mg twice daily\n\n**Allergies:**\n*   No Known Drug Allergies\n\n**Family History:**\n*   Father was diagnosed with prostate cancer at age 68.\n*   Mother has a history of hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes.\n*   No known family history of breast, ovarian, or colon cancer.\n\n**Social History:**\nThe patient is a retired construction worker. He is a widower with two adult children who live nearby. He denies any history of tobacco use and reports drinking alcohol socially (1-2 beers per month). He engages in regular physical activity, primarily walking.\n\n**Physical Examination:**\n*   **Vitals:** Blood Pressure 132/78 mmHg, Heart Rate 72 bpm, Respiratory Rate 16/min, Temperature 98.6\u00b0F.\n*   **Genitourinary:** Normal external male genitalia. Digital Rectal Exam (DRE) reveals a non-tender, asymmetrical prostate with an approximately 1.5 cm, firm, indurated nodule on the right posterior lobe.\n\n**Labs and Imaging:**\n*   **PSA:** 6.8 ng/mL\n*   **Prostate Biopsy Pathology:** Adenocarcinoma, present in 4 of 12 cores. Gleason score 7 (3+4).\n*   **Staging:** A subsequent bone scan and CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis were negative for metastatic disease.\n\n**Assessment:**\nLocalized Prostate Cancer, clinical stage T2a, N0, M0."
