The negative HBeAg, positive anti-HBe, and low viral load suggest an inactive carrier state. The patient was likely infected perinatally, which is common for individuals born in regions with high HBV endemicity.\n2.  **Hypertension:** Well-controlled on current medication.\n\n**Plan**\n1.  **Patient Education:** Discussed the diagnosis of chronic Hepatitis B with the patient, including the natural history, low risk of transmission through casual contact, and the importance of long-term monitoring. Explained that the infection was likely acquired at birth.\n2.  **Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Surveillance:** Ordered an abdominal ultrasound and an alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) blood test to establish a baseline and screen for liver cancer. Plan for surveillance every 6 months.\n3.  **Lifestyle Modifications:** Advised the patient to completely avoid alcohol and any over-the-counter medications or supplements that could be toxic to the liver (e.g., high doses of acetaminophen) without physician consultation.\n4.  **Family Screening:** Recommended screening and vaccination for his wife and children if they are not already immune.\n5.  **Follow-up:** Schedule a follow-up appointment in 3 months to review ultrasound/AFP results and recheck liver function tests. Will continue to monitor LFTs and HBV DNA every 6-12 months. Antiviral therapy is not indicated at this time but will be considered if there is evidence of active liver inflammation or a significant increase in viral load in the future."

Counsel patient on the chronic nature of the disease, the importance of medication adherence, and the goal of suppressing the virus to prevent liver damage.\n3.  Strongly advise complete abstinence from alcohol.\n4.  Refer to a Gastroenterologist/Hepatologist for ongoing management.\n5.
