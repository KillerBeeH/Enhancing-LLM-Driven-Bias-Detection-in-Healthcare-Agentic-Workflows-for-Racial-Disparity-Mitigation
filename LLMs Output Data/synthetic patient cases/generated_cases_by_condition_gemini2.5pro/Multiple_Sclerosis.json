It lasted for about two weeks and then resolved completely. At the time, she attributed it to stress and eye strain from grading papers and did not seek medical attention.

The clinical presentation is highly suspicious for a relapse of Multiple Sclerosis, likely the relapsing-remitting subtype."

The diagnosis was confirmed with MRI showing multiple periventricular and juxtacortical T2 hyperintensities, including an actively enhancing lesion in the cervical spine. She was started on a disease-modifying therapy (DMT) at that time.\n\nShe presents today for evaluation of a suspected relapse. Over the past week, she reports a progressive worsening of her balance, causing her to feel unsteady on her feet and hold onto furniture when walking at home. She also notes the return of a \"pins and needles\" sensation from her knees down, similar to her initial presentation but less severe. She denies any new visual changes, weakness, or cognitive issues.\n\n**Past Medical History:**\n*   Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS), diagnosed 3 years ago.\n*   Iron-deficiency anemia, managed with oral iron supplementation.\n*   No past surgical history.\n\n**Medications:**\n*   Dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera) 240 mg twice daily.\n*   Ferrous sulfate 325 mg daily.\n*   Vitamin D3 2000 IU daily.\n\n**Allergies:**\n*   No known drug allergies.\n\n**Family History:**\n*   Mother, 55, has hypertension.\n*   Father, 58, is healthy.\n*   No family history of multiple sclerosis or other autoimmune disorders.\n\n**Social History:**\n*   **Occupation:** Elementary school teacher.\n*   **Living Situation:** Lives alone in a second-floor apartment.\n*   **Substance Use:** Denies tobacco use or illicit drug use.
