His constellation of symptoms\u2014including fever, pharyngitis, widespread tender lymphadenopathy, myalgias, and a truncal maculopapular rash\u2014is highly suggestive of Acute Retroviral Syndrome (ARS), the symptomatic primary infection stage of HIV. The patient's demographic profile and reported risk factors further increase the clinical suspicion for a new HIV diagnosis."
