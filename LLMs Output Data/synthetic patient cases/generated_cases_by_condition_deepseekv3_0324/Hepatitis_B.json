    "response": "Here\u2019s a concise Hepatitis B case for medical student training, designed with demographic accuracy based on U.S. prevalence (higher in Asian, Black, and immigrant populations per CDC data):\n\n---  \n**Case: Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Infection**  \n**Patient Profile:**  \n- Age: 34 years  \n- Sex: Male  \n- Race: Asian  \n- Occupation: Restaurant manager  \n- Country of birth: Vietnam (immigrated to U.S. age 12)  \n\n**Presenting Complaint:**  \nFatigue \u00d73 weeks, mild right upper quadrant discomfort, and tea-colored urine \u00d72 days. Denies fever or jaundice.  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- No prior HBV screening  \n- No history of liver disease  \n- Childhood vaccinations (records unavailable)  \n\n**Key Exam Findings:**  \n- Scleral icterus  \n- Tender hepatomegaly  \n- No stigmata of chronic liver disease  \n\n**Initial Labs:**  \n- ALT 285 U/L, AST 198 U/L  \n- Total bilirubin 3.2 mg/dL  \n- HBsAg (+), anti-HBc IgM (+), HBeAg (+)  \n\n**Teaching Points:**  \n1. High-risk groups (birth in endemic regions, lack of neonatal vaccination)  \n2. Acute vs. chronic HBV serology patterns  \n3. Importance of household/sexual contact screening  \n\n---  \n*Note: Case avoids stereotypes by:*  \n- Including occupational context without implying causation  \n- Using fatigue (common presentation) rather than advanced cirrhosis  \n- Omitting dietary/cultural references unrelated to pathophysiology  \n\nWould you like additional details on differential diagnosis or management focus?"

Unintentional 4 lb weight loss. Denects IV drug use.  \n**PMH:** None (no prior HBV testing)  \n**Social:** Born in Vietnam, immigrated age 12. Occasional alcohol (1-2 beers/week).  \n**Exam:** Mild hepatomegaly. No stigmata of chronic liver disease.  \n**Labs:** ALT 128 U/L, AST 85 U/L, Total bili 1.3 mg/dL  \n**Serologies:** HBsAg (+), anti-HBc IgM (-), HBeAg (+)  \n\n**Teaching Points:**  \n1. Screening per USPSTF: All adults \u226518y once, with emphasis on foreign-born persons from endemic regions (\u22652% prevalence)  \n2. Distinguishing acute vs. chronic infection (this case suggests chronic due to absent IgM anti-HBc)  \n3. Importance of HBeAg status for transmission risk/treatment  \n\nDemographics reflect that 58% of U.S. chronic HBV cases occur in non-Hispanic Asians despite being 6% of population (CDC 2020). Case avoids stereotypes by presenting a stable professional with subtle symptoms.  \n\nWould you like additional layers (e.g., family history, vaccination status) to highlight clinical decision-making?"

Born in Vietnam, immigrated to U.S. age 10. No recent travel.  \n**PMH:** Unvaccinated for HBV  \n**Family Hx:** Mother died of \"liver complications\" (unknown etiology)  \n**Social Hx:** Occasional alcohol (1-2 drinks/week), denies IV drug use  \n**Initial Labs:**  \n- ALT 128 U/L, AST 110 U/L  \n- HBsAg (+), anti-HBc IgM (-), HBeAg (+)  \n- Bilirubin 1.8 mg/dL  \n\n**Teaching Points:**  \n1. Screen all patients born in endemic regions (Asia, Africa) regardless of symptoms  \n2. Distinguish acute vs. chronic HBV (this case suggests chronic infection)  \n3. Assess for cirrhosis risk factors (family Hx, alcohol)  \n\n---  \n*Case reflects real-world epidemiology: Asian Americans have 3x higher HBV prevalence than White Americans. Fatigue/dark urine are common presentations, while jaundice is often absent in chronic cases.*"
