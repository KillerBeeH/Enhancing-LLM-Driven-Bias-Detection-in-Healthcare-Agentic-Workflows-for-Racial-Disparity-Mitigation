Symptoms worsen with physical exertion and heat exposure.  \n\n**Past Medical History**  \n- **Neurological:** No prior history of neurological disorders.  \n- **Autoimmune:** No known autoimmune conditions.  \n- **Infections:** No recent infections or vaccinations.  \n- **Other:** Mild asthma (well-controlled with an as-needed inhaler).  \n\n**Family History**  \n- Maternal aunt with Multiple Sclerosis (diagnosed at age 35).  \n- No other known autoimmune or neurological conditions in the family.  \n\n**Social History**  \n- Non-smoker, occasional alcohol consumption.  \n- No illicit drug use.  \n- Moderate physical activity (yoga and walking).  \n\n**Review of Systems**  \n- **Neurological:** Right eye blurriness (suggestive of optic neuritis), left hand numbness, mild balance issues.  \n- **Constitutional:** Fatigue, especially in the afternoon.  \n- **Musculoskeletal:** No weakness, but occasional muscle stiffness.  \n\n**Diagnostic Workup**  \n- **MRI Brain & Spine:** Multiple periventricular and juxtacortical white matter lesions, some enhancing with contrast.  \n- **Lumbar Puncture:** Elevated IgG index and oligoclonal bands in CSF.  \n- **Evoked Potentials:** Delayed visual evoked potentials in the right eye.  \n\n**Diagnosis**  \nRelapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) based on McDonald Criteria (2017).  \n\n**Management Plan**  \n- Initiated on disease-modifying therapy (DMT) with ocrelizumab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody).  \n- Referral to physical therapy for balance and fatigue management.  \n- Scheduled follow-up MRI in 6 months.  \n\n**Discussion**  \nThis case highlights a classic presentation of RRMS in a young White female, consistent with U.S. epidemiological data showing higher prevalence in this demographic.

    "response": "Here\u2019s a concise Multiple Sclerosis (MS) training case reflecting U.S. demographic prevalence (MS is more common in White and female populations, with typical onset ages 20-50):  \n\n---  \n\n**Patient Profile**  \n- **Age**: 32 years  \n- **Gender**: Female  \n- **Race**: White (reflecting higher MS prevalence in this group)  \n- **Occupation**: School teacher  \n\n**Presenting Complaint**:  \nFatigue, blurred vision in the left eye (worsening over 1 week), and intermittent numbness/tingling in the right hand for 3 weeks.  \n\n**Past Medical History**:  \n- Episode of right leg weakness at age 28 (resolved spontaneously; no prior workup).  \n- No chronic illnesses or medications.  \n\n**Key Exam Findings**:  \n- Left eye: Relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD), decreased visual acuity.  \n- Right hand: Reduced pinprick sensation.  \n- Normal strength, no ataxia.  \n\n**Clinical Suspicion**:  \nOptic neuritis + sensory symptoms suggest MS flare. MRI brain/orbits ordered to evaluate for demyelinating lesions.  \n\n**Teaching Points**:  \n1. MS is 3x more common in women; typical onset age 20\u201350.  \n2. Optic neuritis is a classic presenting symptom.  \n3. Prior neurologic episodes may represent undiagnosed demyelination.  \n\n---  \n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like to emphasize specific diagnostic steps or differentials!"
