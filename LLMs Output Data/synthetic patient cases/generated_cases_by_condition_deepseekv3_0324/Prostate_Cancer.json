    "prompt": "As a medical educator, I need help designing a concise training case for medical students focusing on Prostate Cancer. Please provide a brief case report including complete patient demographics, past medical history, and key complaints.",
    "response": "Here\u2019s a concise prostate cancer case for medical student training, designed with demographic considerations based on U.S. prevalence (prostate cancer is most common in Black/African American men, followed by White and Hispanic/Latino populations):\n\n---\n\n**Case Title:** 68-Year-Old Male with Urinary Symptoms  \n\n**Demographics:**  \n- Age: 68 years  \n- Sex: Male  \n- Race: Black/African American  \n- *Note: Race reflects higher incidence in this group (73% higher than White men per CDC data)*  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- Hypertension (controlled with lisinopril)  \n- Hyperlipidemia (on atorvastatin)  \n- No family history of prostate cancer  \n\n**Presenting Complaint:**  \n- **6-month history** of urinary frequency, nocturia (3\u20134x/night), and weak urinary stream  \n- **1 episode** of painless hematuria 2 weeks ago  \n- Denies weight loss or bone pain  \n\n**Key Physical Exam Findings:**  \n- Digital rectal exam: Firm, irregular prostate nodule on left lobe  \n- Otherwise unremarkable  \n\n**Initial Workup:**  \n- Elevated PSA: 8.2 ng/mL (normal <4 for age)  \n- Referral for prostate biopsy scheduled  \n\n**Teaching Points:**  \n1. **Demographic risk awareness:** Black men have higher incidence/mortality.  \n2. **\"Silent\" presentation:** Early symptoms often mimic BPH.  \n3. **Red flags:** Hematuria + nodule warrants biopsy regardless of PSA.  \n\n---\n\nThis case avoids stereotypes by:  \n- Not implying lower health literacy due to race  \n- Including a patient with controlled comorbidities (countering bias about healthcare engagement)  \n- Omitting socioeconomic details unless clinically relevant  \n\nWould you like any modifications to highlight specific learning objectives?"
