Below is a concise case presentation for a patient, designed to reflect the demographic distribution of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the U.S. while avoiding stereotypes.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Case Presentation: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**  \n\n#### **Demographics**  \n- **Age:** 32 years  \n- **Sex:** Female (SLE is more common in women, with a female-to-male ratio of ~9:1)  \n- **Race:** Black/African American (SLE is 2-3x more prevalent in Black women compared to White women in the U.S.)  \n\n#### **Chief Complaint**  \n- \"I\u2019ve had joint pain, fatigue, and a rash on my face for the past few weeks.\"  \n\n#### **Past Medical History**  \n- **Diagnoses:**  \n  - Hypertension (diagnosed 2 years ago, on lisinopril)  \n  - Iron-deficiency anemia (treated with oral iron supplements)  \n- **Prior Hospitalizations:** None  \n- **Surgeries:** None  \n\n#### **Relevant Family History**  \n- Mother has SLE.  \n- Maternal aunt with rheumatoid arthritis.  \n\n#### **Social History**  \n- Non-smoker, occasional alcohol use.  \n- Works as a teacher; reports increased stress over the past year.  \n\n#### **Review of Systems**  \n- **Constitutional:** Fatigue, low-grade fevers.  \n- **Musculoskeletal:** Symmetrical joint pain (hands, knees).  \n- **Dermatologic:** Malar rash, photosensitivity.  \n- **Renal:** No hematuria or edema.  \n\n#### **Initial Workup Considerations**  \n- **Labs:** CBC (anemia, leukopenia), ANA, anti-dsDNA, complement levels (C3/C4).  \n- **Urinalysis:** To assess for proteinuria.  \n- **Imaging:** Chest X-ray if pleuritic symptoms develop.  \n\n#### **Differential Diagnosis**  \n1. Systemic lupus erythematosus (highest suspicion).  \n2. Rheumatoid arthritis.  \n3. Dermatomyositis.  \n\n---  \n\nThis case reflects the higher prevalence of SLE in young Black/African American women while incorporating realistic comorbidities (e.g., hypertension, anemia).

She reports a photosensitive malar rash that worsens with sun exposure. Denies fever but notes occasional mouth ulcers.  \n\n**Past Medical History:**  \n- Hypertension (diagnosed age 25)  \n- No prior autoimmune diagnoses  \n\n**Family History:**  \n- Maternal aunt with lupus  \n\n**Physical Exam:**  \n- Vital signs: BP 142/88, HR 82, afebrile  \n- Malar erythema (sparing nasolabial folds)  \n- Tenderness in 2nd/3rd MCP joints bilaterally  \n- No synovitis or joint swelling  \n\n**Key Teaching Points:**  \n1. **Demographic risk factors:** Young Black women have higher lupus incidence.  \n2. **Diagnostic clues:** Malar rash + polyarthralgia + fatigue = SLE suspicion.  \n3. **Next steps:** Order ANA, anti-dsDNA, CBC (watch for cytopenias), urinalysis (proteinuria screening).  \n\n**Why This Case?**  \n- Reflects real-world prevalence while avoiding stereotypes (e.g., includes HTN as common comorbidity without implying causation by race).  \n- Highlights classic SLE features without rare manifestations.  \n\nWould you like any modifications to focus on specific competencies (e.g., differential diagnosis, treatment initiation)?  \n\n*Data sources: CDC lupus epidemiology, 2019 ACR diagnostic criteria.*"
