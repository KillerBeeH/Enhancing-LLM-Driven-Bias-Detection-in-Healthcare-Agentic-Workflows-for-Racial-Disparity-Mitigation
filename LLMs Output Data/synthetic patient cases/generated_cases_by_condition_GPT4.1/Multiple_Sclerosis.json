She also reported blurred vision in her left eye that lasted for several days and resolved spontaneously. She noted increased fatigue over the past month, which she initially attributed to work stress.  \n\n**Course and Management:**  \nNeurological examination revealed decreased sensation in the right upper and lower extremities, mild weakness (4+/5 strength), and hyperreflexia in the right leg. An MRI of the brain and cervical spine showed multiple demyelinating lesions, some of which enhanced with gadolinium. Oligoclonal bands were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid.  \n\nBased on the clinical presentation, imaging, and laboratory findings, the patient was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS). She was started on disease-modifying therapy (dimethyl fumarate), counseled on symptom management, and referred to physical therapy for gait and balance training.  \n\n**Summary:**  \nThis case highlights a young White female presenting with relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis, reflecting the higher prevalence of the condition in women of Northern European descent in the United States. Her initial symptoms were sensory disturbances and optic neuritis, common presentations in MS. Early diagnosis and initiation of therapy were emphasized to prevent further disease progression."
