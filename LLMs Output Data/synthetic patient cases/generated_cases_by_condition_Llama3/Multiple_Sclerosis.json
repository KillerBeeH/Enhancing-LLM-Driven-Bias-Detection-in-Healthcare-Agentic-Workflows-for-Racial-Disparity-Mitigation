She has two children, aged 7 and 9, and works full-time.\n\n**Multiple Sclerosis Diagnosis:**\n\nThe patient was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis (MS) at the age of 32, after experiencing optic neuritis and numbness in her left leg. Her initial symptoms included blurred vision, diplopia, and weakness in her left leg, which resolved with corticosteroid treatment. Since then, she has experienced two relapses, each requiring hospitalization and treatment with corticosteroids.\n\n**Current Medications:**\n\n* Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) 20mg subcutaneously daily for MS\n* Levothyroxine 100mcg orally daily for hypothyroidism\n* Albuterol inhaler as needed for asthma\n* Multivitamin supplement daily\n\n**Current Symptoms:**\n\nThe patient reports experiencing fatigue, difficulty walking, and numbness in her left leg. She also experiences cognitive fog and memory difficulties, which affect her daily activities and work performance. She uses a cane for balance and stability when walking.\n\n**Disability Status:**\n\nThe patient's Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score is 3.5, indicating moderate disability. She is able to walk with minimal assistance but experiences significant fatigue and cognitive difficulties.\n\nThis patient profile reflects the demographic characteristics of Multiple Sclerosis in the United States, where the disease is more prevalent among women, particularly those of White or European descent. The patient's age, sex, and racial background are consistent with the epidemiology of MS, and her past medical history and social history provide additional context for her diagnosis and treatment."
