He also has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to a long history of smoking, although he quit 10 years ago. Additionally, he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 5 years ago and manages it through diet and oral medication. The patient had a cholecystectomy 15 years ago and has no known drug allergies.\n\n**Social History:**\nThe patient is a retired mechanic and has been married for 45 years. He has two adult children and four grandchildren. He lives with his wife in a single-story house. The patient has a 50-pack-year smoking history but quit 10 years ago. He consumes alcohol occasionally, typically on social occasions.\n\n**Family History:**\nThere is a family history of cardiovascular disease; his father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 65. His mother is alive at 90 years old with a history of osteoporosis and dementia.\n\n**Chief Complaint:**\nThe patient presents to the emergency department with a 3-day history of worsening cough, fever, and shortness of breath. He reports that his symptoms started with a mild cough and progressed to include high fever, chills, and difficulty breathing.\n\n**Current Medications:**\n- Lisinopril 20mg daily for hypertension\n- Metformin 500mg twice daily for type 2 diabetes\n- Albuterol inhaler as needed for COPD\n- Atorvastatin 40mg daily for hyperlipidemia\n\n**Physical Examination:**\nUpon examination, the patient appears ill and is febrile with a temperature of 102.5\u00b0F (39.1\u00b0C). He is tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute and has a blood oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Lung auscultation reveals bilateral crackles and wheezes, more pronounced on the right side. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.\n\n**Diagnostic Tests:**\n- Chest X-ray showing bilateral infiltrates consistent with pneumonia\n- Blood cultures pending\n- Sputum Gram stain showing gram-positive cocci\n- Complete Blood Count (CBC) showing leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15,000 cells/\u03bcL\n\n**Assessment and Plan:**\nThe patient is diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia, likely caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae given the gram-positive cocci on the sputum Gram stain. He is started on intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin. The patient is also placed on oxygen therapy to maintain a saturation above 92%. Monitoring of his vital signs, oxygen saturation, and clinical status will be performed closely. The patient's COPD and diabetes management will also be addressed during his hospital stay.\n\n**Prognosis:**\nGiven the patient's age and underlying health conditions, particularly his history of COPD, he is at higher risk for complications from pneumonia. However, with prompt and appropriate antibiotic treatment, oxygen therapy, and supportive care, the prognosis is guarded. Close monitoring and adjustment of the treatment plan as necessary will be crucial in managing his condition effectively."
