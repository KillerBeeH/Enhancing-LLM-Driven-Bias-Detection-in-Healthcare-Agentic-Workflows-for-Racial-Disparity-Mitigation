Notable findings include bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy on chest X-ray and skin lesions consistent with erythema nodosum on her lower extremities.\n\n**Diagnostic Tests:**\n- Chest X-ray: Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy\n- High-Resolution CT (HRCT) of the chest: Confirms lymphadenopathy and shows pulmonary nodules consistent with sarcoidosis\n- Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs): Show a restrictive pattern with decreased DLCO\n- Serum Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) levels: Elevated\n- Biopsy of skin lesions: Non-caseating granulomas consistent with sarcoidosis\n\n**Diagnosis:**\nBased on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and biopsy results, the patient is diagnosed with pulmonary sarcoidosis.\n\n**Treatment Plan:**\nThe patient will be started on prednisone 20mg daily for 3 months to control her symptoms and reduce inflammation. She will also be referred to a pulmonologist for further management and monitoring of her lung disease. Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to assess her response to treatment and adjust her medication regimen as necessary.\n\n**Prognosis:**\nThe prognosis for sarcoidosis varies widely depending on the severity of the disease and the organs involved. With appropriate treatment, many patients experience significant improvement in their symptoms and quality of life. However, some may develop chronic disease requiring long-term management. The patient will be closely monitored for any signs of disease progression or complications."
