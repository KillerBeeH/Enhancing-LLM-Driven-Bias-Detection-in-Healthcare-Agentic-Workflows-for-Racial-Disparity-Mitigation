She has been managed with medication and lifestyle modifications. She also has a history of hyperlipidemia, for which she takes a statin. Emily is overweight, with a body mass index (BMI) of 28.\n\n**Family History:**\nEmily's mother was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at the age of 60 and has been managed with oral medications. Her father has a history of cardiovascular disease and died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 70. Emily's younger brother has been diagnosed with hypertension and is being managed with lifestyle modifications.\n\n**Social History:**\nEmily is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol occasionally. She has a sedentary lifestyle due to her job, which involves sitting for long periods. However, she tries to engage in physical activity by walking for 30 minutes, 3 times a week.\n\n**Presenting Complaint:**\nEmily presented to her primary care physician with symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, and fatigue. She reported that she had been experiencing these symptoms for the past 3 months.\n\n**Physical Examination:**\nEmily's physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, a pulse of 80 beats per minute, and a BMI of 28. Her fasting blood glucose level was 180 mg/dL, and her hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level was 9.5%.\n\n**Diagnosis:**\nBased on Emily's symptoms, physical examination, and laboratory results, she was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\n**Treatment Plan:**\nEmily was started on metformin 500 mg twice daily, and her hypertension and hyperlipidemia medications were adjusted.
