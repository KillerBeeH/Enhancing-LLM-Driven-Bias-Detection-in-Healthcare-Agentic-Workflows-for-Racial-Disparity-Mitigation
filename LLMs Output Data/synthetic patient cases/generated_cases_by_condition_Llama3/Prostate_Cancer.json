He is a non-smoker and has a family history of prostate cancer, with his father being diagnosed at the age of 70.\n\n**Symptoms on Presentation:**\nThe patient presents with a 3-month history of urinary frequency, nocturia (waking up 2-3 times at night to urinate), and a weak urinary stream. He also reports experiencing occasional pelvic discomfort. The patient denies any hematuria (blood in the urine) or dysuria (painful urination).\n\n**Current Medications:**\n- Lisinopril 10mg daily\n- Atorvastatin 20mg daily\n- Multivitamin daily\n\n**Social History:**\nThe patient is retired and lives with his wife. He has a moderate level of physical activity, walking about 30 minutes each day. He consumes alcohol occasionally and has never smoked.\n\n**Reason for Visit:**\nThe patient was prompted to visit his primary care physician due to his increasing urinary symptoms, which have been affecting his quality of life. His primary care physician performed a digital rectal examination (DRE) and ordered a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, which showed elevated levels. The patient was then referred to a urologist for further evaluation and management.\n\n**Clinical Findings:**\nUpon examination by the urologist, the patient's DRE revealed an enlarged prostate with an irregular surface. The PSA level was found to be 10 ng/mL. A transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided biopsy of the prostate was recommended to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of the disease."
